# general information  
* this week's project was to make a fully functional quiz wiht javascript. it needed to have a timer and also needed to save and delete scores when user would like to. My quiz has 5 questions, all pertaining to coding. The user is given 100 seconds to complete the quiz and is penalized 20 seconds if the user answers the question incorrectly. When the user has finished the quiz, They are made to put their intials and submit it. Then the score is saved with their initials. The user has a choice to clear the data.

* I made and html css and javascript file all named 'quiz'.
* Made a container having all header and buttons for the html and I displayed none using css.
* for every id tag I made an get element by id for headers,containers, and buttons.
* made an array of questions to later use in the functions.
* made global variables, for timer, score and the .lenght
* made a function to generate questions
* made a function to start the quiz and also calls for the generate question function that has a timer and if the timer hits 0, an alert pops up that says time is up.
and it shows score through a function that shows score.
* made function that displays the highscore through making a div from the get element by id variables. 
*  made function that clears the score through clear method that empties the local storage. 
* made replay function that just puts the quiz intervals back to the original form.
* also made function that checks answers for question and if the question is qrong, it subtracts 20 secs.
