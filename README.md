# general information  
* this week's project was to make a fully functional quiz wiht javascript. it needed to have a timer and also needed to save and delete scores when user would like to. My quiz has 5 questions, all pertaining to coding. The user is given 100 seconds to complete the quiz and is penalized 20 seconds if the user answers the question incorrectly. When the user has finished the quiz, They are made to put their intials and submit it. Then the score is saved with their initials. The user has a choice to clear the data.
